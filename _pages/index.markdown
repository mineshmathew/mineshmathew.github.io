I am a Machine learning scientist at [Wadhwani AI][17]. Previously, I was a  MS + PhD  student under   [Prof. C. V Jawahar][1]  at [IIIT Hyderabad][2].  I had obtained my undergraduate degree in Btech Computer Science Engineering from [NIT Warangal][3] in 2009.



My PhD research deals with machine-understanding of document images. Specifically, I look into the problems of [OCR in Indian languages][5],  [Scene text understanding][6] and [Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA)][8]
